# Newonce upon a time 
## This is the backend part of the project created during the hackathon [Hack4Music](https://www.elpassion.com/hack4music).  Its aim was to build a functionality or an app using the API provided by Newonce [API](https://newonce-api.herokuapp.com/api).

## Newonce upon a time is a widget which was placed on the main website's page in the right upper corner.

## This widget shows all the content added to the page on the same day, but in the previous years. Using the calendar the user can choose the day he/she wants to go back to.

## Benefits for Newonce:
###### - It shows a valuable content that was published in the previous years.
###### - Increases clicks on the page and keeps the user occupied for a longer time.

## Benefits for the user:
###### - It's easier to access some older, but still valuable content.
###### - It's an interesting way of checking up on what content was added on a particular day.
