# Newonce upon a time 
## This is the backend REST API part of the project created during the hackathon [Hack4Music&Data](https://www.elpassion.com/hack4music).  Its aim was to build a functionality or an app using the [API](https://newonce-api.herokuapp.com/api) provided by Newonce.

###### Newonce upon a time is a widget which was placed on the main website's page in the right upper corner. It shows all the content added to the page on the same day, but in the previous years. Using the calendar one can choose the day he/she wants to go back to and explore the content added to the website on that particular day.

###### As it was unefficient to use all the data provided in API, we took some examples of content and put the records to the postgresql database.
###### The database contains some of: releases, articles, podcasts and videos published on 19 an 20 of Nov. in the years 2018, 2019 and 2020.
